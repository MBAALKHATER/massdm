> MassDM v3, a bot to send DMs to every member of a role in Discord server.


**Use this tool at your own risk!**

You will need two things installed to make this bot work. If you're on Windows, simply run the new start.bat program, it can get the prerequisite programs for you!

- Node.JS(LTS version). https://nodejs.org/en/
- A code editor. https://notepad-plus-plus.org/


> Open `config.json` in your code editor and edit the token with your bot token or your user token. [or remove the "REM" and replate "YOUR TOKEN" in start.bat]

You also need to add in your whitelisted ID (id field in `config.json`); Place the ID of the user who will control the bot.
Once you have that done, save the file.


> Once it has finished installing all the dependencies, you can run `start.bat`.

*If you are not running Windows, you need to open a terminal in the bot folder and type "node app.js" without quotes.*



Ideas for development:
- [x] env var token
- [ ] customize bot status
